    <h2>Music Theory: </h2>
	<h2>The Basics of Song Making</h2>
	<h3>What is Music Theory?</h3>
	<p>
		Music theory is how musicians explain and describe the phenomena heard in 
		a musical composition. Music theory defines the core aspects of music and 
		provides a system for musicians to communicate their ideas to one another.
	</p>
	<h3>Why should you learn music theory?</h3>
	<p>
		All musicians can benefit from learning some aspects of music theory.

		Understanding music theory concepts is the key to progressing on your instrument, 
		writing better songs and breaking through creative blocks. You do not need an 
		expensive teacher, you can pick up the important parts of music theory by learning 
		on your own and applying the concepts to your everyday music practice.

	<h3>Chords: How Notes Work Together</h3>

		Chords are the individual units of harmony. They occur whenever groups of consonant pitches are sounded together.
		The relationship between the pitch of two tones is known as an interval. The type of intervals contained inside a chord determine its chord quality.
		You might already be familiar with major and minor the two basic chord qualities. But there is much more to discover.
		The way the pitches combine within the structure of a chord and the way different chords interact with one another are defining parts of a songs identity.
		Putting chords together in sequences is one of the basic parts of songwriting. A musically pleasing sequence of chords is called a chord progression.
		Learning how to build individual chords and arrange them together is a skill you can improve by learning music theory.

	<h3>Scales: The Basis of Melody</h3>

		Scales are the next major rudiment in music.
		Scales are the raw material for melodies. Any melodic musical passage with a singable tune relies on a scale for its form.
		A scale is a sequential collection of notes with a specific pattern of tones and semitones. 
		This pattern determines the sound of the scale and the way it’s used in songs. Different scales bring different moods, 
		emotions and characteristics to a piece—and allow for different melodic possibilities. The two basic scales are the major and minor, 
		The major scale follows the pattern tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone. The minor scale follows the 
		pattern tone-semitone-tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone. But that’s only the beginning. There are plenty of different scales out there,
		 each with its own unique melodic signature. Scales have just as big an impact as chords when it comes to forming a song’s sonic identity.
		 Scales and chords are the main rudiments you need to understand to start making music.
