    <h3>About the Creator</h3>
    <p> 
        I am a 3-year college student at Seattle University where I am pursuing a degree in computer science
        I created this website for my web design class and I thought it was a good opportunity to do a project
        that was interesting to me. I was tired of making programs that were not interesting and so I made this website.
        I have liked music and I always wanted a site where I could make simple music just for fun and that was the goal of this website.
        I have not completly finished it to my liking so I hope to make more adjustments in the future.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Create this Site?</h3>
    <p>
        This site was made for people who have an interest in music and it
        was made to help them learn about music making in a simple and fun manner.
        I have some simple resources for those newer to music to read and get a better understanding of music.
        I also made it very simple, just press a key to make a sound, this makes it easier to learn and an easy to pick up site.
    </p>
    <h3>Future of this Site</h3>
    <p>
        I want to make it so that the user can have accsess to more sounds and more keys.
        I won't add too much to confuse the user, but to add some other popular instruments like violin.
        I also want to add a record button so people can record little snippits of music that they have made.
